# Translator: A Transfer Learning Approach to Facilitate Single-Cell ATAC-Seq Data Analysis from Reference Dataset

Translator is a deep generative model-based representation learning model to create better cell embeddings for lower-quality samples with the help of a reference dataset. This implementation uses PyTorch as its backend. 

## Setup

To install the software, please clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/aicb-ZhangLabs/Translator.git
```

Then, please install all dependencies by using anaconda:

```
conda env create -f translator.yml
conda activate translator
```

## Model training with reference dataset

## Embedding generation

## Embedding export

## Embedding visualization and evaluation
